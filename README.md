Packages that need to be installed include the following:
1. pip install pyaudio: This might not work for some IDE as it did not work for me. In such case, you need to install pipwin before installing the pyaudio that is specific to your python
2. pip install pyttsx3
3. pip install wikipedia
4. pip install GoogleMaps
5. pip install pywhatkit
6. Install Flask; sometimes, the pywhatkit will not work if Flask is not installed
